# Pune_house_price_prediction
In this project, I used Machine Learning algorithms, with a focus on Random Forest, to create a robust house price prediction model using Pune house price data sourced from Kaggle. The website was developed using Flask for the backend, ensuring efficient data handling, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for responsive frontend design.
